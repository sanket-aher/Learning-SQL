## Introduction

The UNION and UNION ALL operators in SQL are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries. While they serve similar purposes, they have distinct differences in how they handle duplicate records.

## SQL UNION Operator

The UNION operator combines the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set, excluding duplicate rows. The columns and the data types in the SELECT statements must match to use UNION.

## SQL UNION ALL Operator

The UNION ALL operator also combines the results of two or more SELECT queries, but it includes all duplicate rows in the final result set. This makes UNION ALL faster than UNION because it does not perform the additional step of removing duplicates.

## Difference Between UNION and UNION ALL

1. **Duplicates Handling:**
   - **UNION:** Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
   - **UNION ALL:** Includes all duplicate rows in the result set.

2. **Performance:**
   - **UNION:** Slower due to the additional step of removing duplicates.
   - **UNION ALL:** Faster as it does not remove duplicates.

3. **Use Case:**
   - **UNION:** Use when you need a distinct set of records.
   - **UNION ALL:** Use when you need all records, including duplicates.
