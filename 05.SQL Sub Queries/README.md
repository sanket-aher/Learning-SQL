## Introduction

Subqueries, also known as inner queries or nested queries, are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to embed a query within another query. This helps in performing more complex operations and can improve the efficiency and readability of your SQL code.

## What is a Subquery?

A subquery is a query nested inside another query, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. The subquery provides results that are used by the main query to filter or manipulate data. Subqueries can return individual values or result sets and can be used in various parts of a SQL statement.

## Using Subqueries with SQL Clauses

Subqueries can be used with the following SQL clauses:

- **WHERE:** To filter results based on the outcome of the subquery.
- **FROM:** To use the subquery as a temporary table.
- **SELECT:** To include a column in the result set based on the subquery.
